*Mini-map and world map integration.  ARL will now work with TomTom to add icons to your world map and mini-map when you do a scan.  These icons do not persist through sessions (done on purpose as to not clutter up your map) and will only show up with TomTom enabled.  You can get TomTom [[http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info7032.html|here]].
*The addon is now LoD with the tradeskill UI.  This means that ARL will not be loaded until you open up a trade skill window, this saving you memory.
