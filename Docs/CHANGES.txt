==ARL Changes

===RC8
*Fixed a bug when you did a scan, the drop down menus for the profession would change text to something non-existant.
*Added all/none functionality for classes, reputations.
*All/none functionality has changed, now you click on the text to select all or none.  There are no individual buttons.  The tooltip explains this in more detail.
*Updated many trainers to coincide with the argent tourney.
*Changed seasonal to be world events as it fits better.  Use the titles from the achievements to track these instead of our own localized string.
*Updated many recipes which had wrong sill levels.
*Added some new datamining functionality.  It will scan the trainer and tell you if this trainer is missing recipes that can be trained on it.  Also compares skill levels.
*Combined wrath reputations which are horde/alliance only. Disabled those reputation which did not have any items (yet).
*Converted to LibQTip for tooltips (makes them a lot easier to deal with).
*Added support for which expansion a recipe was obtained from.
*Added support to track the skill ups of the recipe.
*Fixed a bug when using exclusions, the progress bar numbers would not be accurate.
*Fixed a bug when you would get an error after clicking on an open space near the end of the recipe.
*Added UI elements which will allow you to access alt's tradeskills.  A tooltip is generated which will let you select which alt you print out.
*Fixed a few issues with the frames being saved.

===RC7
*This release is dedicated to the demise of WowMatrix.  May it rot in hell.
*Added formal in-game datamining functions.  These are to be used when you want to see if ARL has accurate data.
*Fixed bug where first aid and cooking were showing 2 less recipes.
*Fixed a nil reference error.
*Fixed a localization error with svn clients.
*Fixed a few leaking globals.
*Code optimization.

===RC6
*Added 3.1 recipes.  These recipes may have inaccurate information.  If so, please submit a ticket and I'll get them updated ASAP.
*Database updates for many recipes.
*Add TipTac support.
*Fixed minor issues with the progress bar and excluded recipes.
*Added some basic tracking for alt professions, no gui/interface for this, but it's being tracked right now for future upgrades to ARL.
*Expanded the classes filter to allow you to select classes individually.
*Localization updates.

===RC5
*Added donation info, please take a look, it's not just about money. :)
*Fixed the LW typo. :P
*Updated some skill levels for patterns.
*All opposite faction acquire methods in the tooltip will now be hidden automatically.  They will still be shown as part of the recipe window depending on your filter settings for faction.
*You can now sort by skill level ascending and descending.
*If you're at a trainer and want to see if the skill levels match those on the trainer, type /arl scandata.  This will do a comparison.  If you use this command wrong, you will get called names, yelled at, no one will like you, and God will kill a kitten.
*You can now customize the font size for the tooltips.  It defaults at 11, however you can change it to betwwwn 8 and 16 now.
*Localization updates (thank you so much to everyone who helps localize, there are currently 1625 strings that need localization with ARL and you guys have done most of them!

===RC4
*Updated recipe information (skill levels, flags, locations, etc)
*Added more fine grained support for Tom Tom integration (Please see the ARL in-game options to see how to configure this.)
*Many minor bug fixes
*New API to get the entire recpie database
*Localization updates

===RC3
*Fixed a bug where you did not have a proper default position for the scan button.
*Fixed the error regarding donglestub.
*Fixed the loading error with ARL-Seasonal.lua that some people were experiencing.
*Fixed the TomTom nil error that some people were experiencing.

===RC2
*You can now customize which tooltips are displayed, and where they are anchored.
*You have more options on where to anchor the scan button.
*Mini-map and world map integration.  ARL will now work with TomTom to add icons to your world map and mini-map when you do a scan.  These icons do not persist through sessions (done on purpose as to not clutter up your map) and will only show up with TomTom enabled.  You can get TomTom [http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info7032.html here].
*The addon is now LoD with the tradeskill UI.  This means that ARL will not be loaded until you open up a trade skill window, this saving you memory.
*Support for Cauldron (including existing support for ATSW, Skillet and Manufac).
*Many recipe updates

===Major Changes Since Initial Release to RC1
*Entire mod rewritten from scratch, including a new GUI by Zhinjio
