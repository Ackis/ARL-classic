==ARL Changes==

===RC5===
*Fixed the LW typo. :P
*Updated some skill levels for patterns.
*All opposite faction acquire methods in the tooltip will now be hidden automatically.  They will still be shown as part of the recipe window depending on your filter settings for faction.
*You can now sort by skill level ascending and descending.
*If you're at a trainer and want to see if the skill levels match those on the trainer, type /arl scandata.  This will do a comparison.  If you use this command wrong, you will get called names, yelled at, no one will like you, and God will kill a kitten.
*You can now customize the font size for the tooltips.  It defaults at 11, however you can change it to betwwwn 8 and 16 now.
*Localization updates (thank you so much to everyone who helps localize, there are currently 1625 strings that need localization with ARL and you guys have done most of them!

===RC4===
*Updated recipe information (skill levels, flags, locations, etc)
*Added more fine grained support for Tom Tom integration (Please see the ARL in-game options to see how to configure this.)
*Many minor bug fixes
*New API to get the entire recpie database
*Localization updates

===RC3===
*Fixed a bug where you did not have a proper default position for the scan button.
*Fixed the error regarding donglestub.
*Fixed the loading error with ARL-Seasonal.lua that some people were experiencing.
*Fixed the TomTom nil error that some people were experiencing.

===RC2===
*You can now customize which tooltips are displayed, and where they are anchored.
*You have more options on where to anchor the scan button.
*Mini-map and world map integration.  ARL will now work with TomTom to add icons to your world map and mini-map when you do a scan.  These icons do not persist through sessions (done on purpose as to not clutter up your map) and will only show up with TomTom enabled.  You can get TomTom [http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info7032.html here].
*The addon is now LoD with the tradeskill UI.  This means that ARL will not be loaded until you open up a trade skill window, this saving you memory.
*Support for Cauldron (including existing support for ATSW, Skillet and Manufac).
*Many recipe updates
