==Donations==
I have setup a donation site via [http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/3462 Pledgie].  Feel free to donate if you like this mod.  I have put countless hours of time and effort into it along with many people who have helped me.  I did not write this mod with the intent to make any money from it.  I wrote it to help me with some needs that I saw in-game, and well with requests and my goal to make it filled with information it's become a massive project.

If you don't wish to donate money feel free to consider one of the following methods which may be more suitable:
* Volunteer time at your local animal shelter such as the [http://www.edmontonhumanesociety.com/ Society for Prevention of Cruelty for Animals (SPCA)] or drop a few bucks off for them.  If you do this, please let [mailto:ackis@shaw.ca me] know.
* Send 	[mailto:ackis@shaw.ca me] some UDE Points.  These points are obtained from the [http://www.wowtcg.com/ World of Warcraft TCG and Mini] game.
* Send some gold to me in-game or help out with some rarer achievements. :)

==Important Notice==
Please note that [http://www.thedevil.com Blizzard] has implemented a draconian [http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/policy/ui.html policy] regarding UI mods and addons.  Essentially they are forcing all addon authors to have their work submitted free of charge.  This addon will not comply with any policy outlined by them.  I neither have agreed to it, nor been given any stake in developing this policy.  I will not abide by it.  That said, many of the existing points in it are enforced by reputable addon development sites (aka the do no harm types).  However, Blizzard has crossed boundries by forcing addon authors to submit their intellectual property for free without a fair means of compensation.

==Comments==
I have disabled comments on Curse.com for multiple reasons.  The main one being people posting comments such as "this is broken" without providing any other information.  Please see the in-game documentation or the Bug Reports section on how to contact me.

==How to get it to work==
You open up a trade skill window (ie: enchanting) and click on the Scan button which is attached to the trade skill window.  Results will be printed out to the chat frame, or into a separate window depending on preference.

===Command Line===
Ackis Recipe List has recently changed to use a GUI for change parameters.  Type <code>/arl</code> to open up the GUI.  Acceptable commands include:
* <code>/arl about</code>
** Opens up the about panel, listing information about the mod.
* <code>/arl sort</code> or <code>/arl sorting</code>
** Opens up the sorting options.
* <code>/arl documentation</code>
** Opens up in-game documentation regarding ARL.
* <code>/arl display</code>
** Opens up display options.
* <code>/arl profile</code>
** Opens up profile options.
* <code>/arl filter</code>
** Opens up filtering options.

** Performs a scan for missing recipes.  This is in place for those times when you cannot access the scan button.

===Clicking===
Ackis Recipe List will behave differently depending on which modifying keys you use to click.

====Scan Button====
This is the functionality that occurs when you are clicking the scan button.

*Normal Click
**Performs a scan of the current tradeskill displaying recipes in a new window.
*Shift Click
**Generates a text dumping of the current tradeskill in CSV format.
*Alt Click
**Removes all waypoints on the World Map and Mini-map generated by ARL.

====Recipe====
This is the functionality that occurs when you click on a recipe.

*Normal Click
**Expands or contracts the recipe acquire information.
*Shift Click
**Generates an item link of the item that the recipe will make into your default chat box.
*Ctrl Click
**Genereates a spell link for the recipe you clicked.
*Alt Click
**Adds or removes a recipe from the exclusion list.
*Ctrl-Shift Click
**Adds the specific recipe acquire methods to the World Map and Mini-map.

==Known Issues==
* When gaining a reputation level recipes for that faction will still appear in red when doing a scan.
* If you have a cooking or first aid book/quest complete, but aren't past the skill level, it'll show the book/quest as unknown (ie: I have read the first aid skill book for skill level 150, however my skill in first aid is only 140, it'll show the book as unknown still).
* Recipe acquire information is slightly inaccurate.  I'm updating recipes daily as information is identified.  If you find something inaccurate or wrong, submit a ticket [http://www.wowace.com/projects/arl/create-ticket/ here] and I will get it updated.

==Feature Requests/Bug Reporting==
Read the [http://www.wowace.com/projects/arl/pages/feedback-and-bug-reporting/ Bug Reporting and Feature Requesting] information ''before'' submitted a bug report or feature request.  Posting reports in the comments is ''not'' the place to do so.  I had to turn off the comments at [http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/arl.aspx Curse.com] because of of constant bug reports and feature requests.  Comments are for questions on how to use the mod, or you can see the thread on [http://forums.wowace.com/showthread.php?t=11142 WoW Ace].  Please follow these small little instructions to make my life easier.  The easier you make development for Ackis Recipe List, the more time I will have to develop other addons.

===Bug Reports===
Please use the [http://www.wowace.com/projects/arl/tickets/ WoW Ace] tracker to file bug reports.  Posting bugs in the comments is not the place to do it.

===Feature Request===
Please use the [http://www.wowace.com/projects/arl/tickets/ WoW Ace] tracker to add suggestions and feature requests.  Not all suggestions will be accepted, there are a lot of people using this addon and I'll try to make it as user friendly, but when a decision is made please accept it.

==Integration==
Ackis Recipe List strives to integrate with existing trade skill mods out there.  If you have a request for integration, please submit a feature request at [http://www.wowace.com/projects/arl/tickets/ WoW Ace].  I make no promises that I will implement the feature at all.  There is a limited API documented at [http://www.wowace.com/projects/arl/pages/api/] to interface with the ARL database.  If you are a developer and would like more functions, please contact me on IRC.
