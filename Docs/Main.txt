==Donations
I have setup a donation site via [[http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/3462|Pledgie]].  Feel free to donate if you like this mod.  I have put countless hours of time and effort into it along with many people who have helped me.  I did not write this mod with the intent to make any money from it.  I wrote it to help me with some needs that I saw in-game, and well with requests and my goal to make it filled with information it's become a massive project.

If you don't wish to donate money feel free to consider one of the following methods which may be more suitable:
* Volunteer time at your local animal shelter such as the [[http://www.edmontonhumanesociety.com/|Society for Prevention of Cruelty for Animals (SPCA)]] or drop a few bucks off for them.  If you do this, please let [[mailto:ackis@shaw.ca|me]] know.
* Send [[mailto:ackis@shaw.ca|me]] some UDE Points.  These points are obtained from the [[http://www.wowtcg.com/|World of Warcraft TCG and Mini]] game.
* Send some gold to one of the authors in-game or help out with some achievements, or even send a message saying thanks. :)

==How to get it to work
You open up a trade skill window (ie: enchanting) and click on the Scan button which is attached to the trade skill window.  Results will be printed out to the chat frame, or into a separate window depending on preference.

===Command Line
Ackis Recipe List has recently changed to use a GUI for change parameters.  Type **/arl** to open up the GUI.  Acceptable commands include:
* Opens up the about panel, listing information about the mod:
<<code>>/arl about<</code>>
** Opens up the sorting options:
 <<code>>/arl sort<</code>> or <<code>>/arl sorting<</code>>
** Opens up in-game documentation regarding ARL:
 <<code>>/arl documentation<</code>>
** Opens up display options:
 <<code>>/arl display<</code>>
** Opens up profile options:
 <<code>>/arl profile<</code>>
** Opens up filtering options:
 <<code>>/arl filter<</code>>
** Performs a scan for missing recipes.  This is in place for those times when you cannot access the scan button:
 <<code>>/arl scan<</code>>

===Clicking
Ackis Recipe List will behave differently depending on which modifying keys you use to click.

====Scan Button
This is the functionality that occurs when you are clicking the scan button.

*Normal Click
**Performs a scan of the current tradeskill displaying recipes in a new window.
*Shift Click
**Generates a text dumping of the current tradeskill in CSV format.
*Alt Click
**Removes all waypoints on the World Map and Mini-map generated by ARL.

====Recipe
This is the functionality that occurs when you click on a recipe.

*Normal Click
**Expands or contracts the recipe acquire information.
*Shift Click
**Generates an item link of the item that the recipe will make into your default chat box.
*Ctrl Click
**Generates a spell link for the recipe you clicked.

==Known Issues
* When gaining a reputation level recipes for that faction will still appear in red when doing a scan.
* Recipe acquire information is slightly inaccurate.  I'm updating recipes daily as information is identified.  If you find something inaccurate or wrong, submit a ticket [[http://www.wowace.com/projects/arl/create-ticket/|here]] and I will get it updated.

===Important Virus Announcement
Some people are reporting that there is a malware warning with some virus scanners.  This is a false positive. I do not know why these scanners are picking it.  As you can see [[http://www.virustotal.com/analisis/822401bc55cb21e280bc527f66f12fb189c727ddb50d8170daad7527defccb90-1249613607 | here]] the zip is clean.  I've submitted the file to a few vendors to get this issue fixed and am looking at ways in code to fix it.

I've just got confirmation back from them [[http://analysis.avira.com/samples/details.php?uniqueid=m0B77IpHpG1zU0CLgNZhmXf3rzm4pMSb&incidentid=353354|here]].  It is now a confirmed false positive.

This is a difference in the code from one version that works, to another version that causes the error:

==Feature Requests/Bug Reporting==
Read the [[http://www.wowace.com/projects/arl/pages/feedback-and-bug-reporting/|Bug Reporting and Feature Requesting]] information //before// submitted a bug report or feature request.  Posting reports in the comments is //not// the place to do so.  I had to turn off the comments at [[http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/arl.aspx|Curse.com]] because of constant bug reports and feature requests.  Comments are for questions on how to use the mod, or you can see the thread on [[http://forums.wowace.com/showthread.php?t=11142|wowace]].  Please follow these small little instructions to make my life easier.  The easier you make development for Ackis Recipe List, the more time I will have to develop other addons.

===Bug Reports===
Please use the [[http://www.wowace.com/projects/arl/tickets/|wowace]] tracker to file bug reports.  Posting bugs in the comments is not the place to do it.

===Feature Request===
Please use the [[http://www.wowace.com/projects/arl/tickets/|wowace]] tracker to add suggestions and feature requests.  Not all suggestions will be accepted, there are a lot of people using this addon and I'll try to make it as user friendly, but when a decision is made please accept it.

==Integration==
Ackis Recipe List strives to integrate with existing trade skill mods out there.  If you have a request for integration, please submit a feature request at [[http://www.wowace.com/projects/arl/tickets/|wowace]].  I make no promises that I will implement the feature at all.  There is a limited [[http://www.wowace.com/projects/arl/pages/api/|API]] documented to interface with the ARL database.  If you are a developer and would like more functions, please contact me on IRC.
Currently, the mod works with:
* [[http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/advanced-trade-skill-window.aspx|Advanced Trade Skill Window]] - [[http://www.wowace.com/projects/arl/images/13-arl-w-atsw/|Screenshot 1]]

==Acknowledgments==

* Ace community for listening to my questions on the IRC channel and helping me out, and fellow mod authors for developing such great add-ons.
