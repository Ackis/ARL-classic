==What it does==
Ackis Recipe List is an addon which will scan your trade skill recipes and print out a list of which recipes you are currently missing.  It will work for all tradeskills including Runeforging.

==Comments==
I have disabled comments on Curse.com for multiple reasons.  The main one being people posting comments such as "this is broken" without providing any other information.  Please see the in-game documentation or the Bug Reports section on how to contact me.

==Where to get it==
* [http://www.wowace.com/projects/arl/files/ WoW Ace] - Alpha Quality
* [http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/arl.aspx Curse] - Stable release
* [http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info8512-AckisRecipeList.html WoWInterface] - Stable release

==How to get it to work==
You open up a trade skill window (ie: enchanting) and click on the Scan button which is attached to the trade skill window.  Results will be printed out to the chat frame, or into a separate window depending on preference.

===Commands===
Ackis Recipe List has recently changed to use a GUI for change parameters.  Type <code>/arl</code> to open up the GUI.  Acceptable commands include:
* <code>/arl about</code>
** Opens up the about panel, listing information about the mod.
* <code>/arl sort</code>
** Opens up the sorting options.
* <code>/arl sorting</code>
** Opens up the sorting options.
* <code>/arl documentation</code>
** Opens up in-game documentation regarding ARL.
* <code>/arl display</code>
** Opens up display options.
* <code>/arl profile</code>
** Opens up profile options.
* <code>/arl filter</code>
** Opens up filtering options.
* <code>/arl scan</code>
** Performs a scan for missing recipes.  This is in place for those times when you cannot access the scan button.

==Known Issues==
* When gaining a reputation level recipes for that faction will still appear in red when doing a scan.
* If you have a cooking or first aid book/quest complete, but aren't past the skill level, it'll show the book/quest as unknown (ie: I have read the first aid skill book for skill level 150, however my skill in first aid is only 140, it'll show the book as unknown still).
* Recipe acquire information is slightly inaccurate.  I'm updating recipes daily as information is identified.  If you find something inaccurate or wrong, submit a ticket [http://www.wowace.com/projects/arl/create-ticket/ here] and I will get it updated.

==Bug Reports==

==Integration==
Ackis Recipe List strives to integrate with existing trade skill mods out there.  If you have a request for integration, please submit a feature request at [http://www.wowace.com/projects/arl/tickets/ WoW Ace].  There is a limited API documented at [http://www.wowace.com/projects/arl/pages/API/] to interface with the ARL database.  If you are a developer and would like more functions, please contact me on IRC.
Currently, the mod works with:
* Advanced Trade Skill Window
* Skillet
* Manufac
