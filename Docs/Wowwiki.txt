==Do this first==
Read the documentation located at these locations:
* [http://www.wowace.com/projects/arl/pages/feedback-and-bug-reporting/ Bug Reporting and Feature Requesting]
* [http://www.wowace.com/projects/arl/pages/in-game-documentation/ In-game Documentation]

==Where to get it==
* [http://www.wowace.com/projects/arl/files/ WoW Ace] - Alpha Quality
* [http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/arl.aspx Curse] - Stable release
* [http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info8512-AckisRecipeList.html WoWInterface] - Stable release

==How to get it to work==
You open up a trade skill window (ie: enchanting) and click on the Scan button which is attached to the trade skill window.  Results will be printed out to the chat frame, or into a separate window depending on preference.

==Feature Requests/Bug Reporting==
Read the [http://www.wowace.com/projects/arl/pages/feedback-and-bug-reporting/ Bug Reporting and Feature Requesting] information ''before'' submitted a bug report or feature request.  Posting reports in the comments is ''not'' the place to do so.  I had to turn off the comments at [http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/arl.aspx Curse.com] because of constant bug reports and feature requests.  Comments are for questions on how to use the mod, or you can see the thread on [http://forums.wowace.com/showthread.php?t=11142 WoW Ace].  Please follow these small little instructions to make my life easier.  The easier you make development for Ackis Recipe List, the more time I will have to develop other addons.

===Bug Reports===
Please use the [http://www.wowace.com/projects/arl/tickets/ WoW Ace] tracker to file bug reports.  Posting bugs in the comments is not the place to do it.

===Feature Request===
Please use the [http://www.wowace.com/projects/arl/tickets/ WoW Ace] tracker to add suggestions and feature requests.  Not all suggestions will be accepted, there are a lot of people using this addon and I'll try to make it as user friendly, but when a decision is made please accept it.

==Integration==
Ackis Recipe List strives to integrate with existing trade skill mods out there.  If you have a request for integration, please submit a feature request at [http://www.wowace.com/projects/arl/tickets/ WoW Ace].  I make no promises that I will implement the feature at all.  There is a limited [http://www.wowace.com/projects/arl/pages/api/ API] documented to interface with the ARL database.  If you are a developer and would like more functions, please contact me on IRC.
Currently, the mod works with:
